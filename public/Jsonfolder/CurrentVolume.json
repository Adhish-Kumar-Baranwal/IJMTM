    "description": "Circular ocean currents called eddies exert significant influence on ocean dynamics, affecting everything from heat circulation to the movement of nutrients. Mesoscale eddies, those that are 100–300 kilometres across, are relatively well studied, but smaller, submesoscale (10–100 km) eddies have proved much harder to view and assess at a global scale. In this week’s issue, Matthew Archer and colleagues present results from the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite that change that, offering a view of ocean dynamics in unprecedented detail.",
